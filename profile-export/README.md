Seven years building multi-tenant SaaS backends in **NestJS, TypeScript and PostgreSQL**. I design AI features to fail predictably: a three-tier fallback of retry, retrieval and a rule-based floor keeps them working through provider outages.

| 7+ | 12s → 2s | 0 | 99.9% |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| years on production backends | dashboard response time, an 83% cut | user-facing AI failures during LLM outages | uptime through live multi-tenant migrations |

### Featured · Designing for AI failure

One abstraction sits in front of OpenAI, Gemini and Anthropic. When a provider degrades, requests step down through three tiers instead of surfacing an error. It became the team's standard failure-handling architecture and cut AI integration complexity by 60%.
